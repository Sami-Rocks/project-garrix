###  Instructions
1. Sign up (or log in if you have already signed up)
2. Schedule an appointment based on the available slots.


## Boblittle's observation and comments 

1. Nice interface UI/UX for homepage 
2. Login and signup redirected nicely 
3. Saw validations for some fields, not all 
4. upon creation of an appointment, it doesn't show/reflect immediately on the appointment list on the right 
5. editing, deleting and creation of appointments works. 

## security 
6. No auth guards implemented [security risk], you can navigate through  all parts of project 
7. the dashboard fails in  this case but no auth guard was implemented from code. 

## code techniques 
8. Files and application arrangement follows the normal angular structure 
9. Good naming choices for folders, like shared, modules, etc 
10. Good implementation for shared components, widgets and pipes, good way for exporting and making components reusable  
11. Good and appropriate naming conventions for method and class names. they reflect what each method does. 
12. eg include `showOrHideForm, generateCalanderDays,localStorageServices` 

## Overall feedback 
13. Couldn't implement to expectation the solution to the assignment provided. Showed the implementation of other technologies
including express for nodejs. Good coding style and choices for project organization and structure. Applicant maybe good,
but will need much supervision and coaching.
